/// in value as you travel right. The y value represents the distance from the top
/// edge of the window or bitmap, and increases as you travel down toward the bottom.

/// one point to another in 2 dimensional space. Internally, the Vector is stored as its
/// x and y components (same as a `Point2D`).

/// Vector is a great way to represent movement or forces. You could use a vector to track
/// how much a character moves each update (as the Vector stores the direction and distance).
/// Similarly, you could use a Vector to represent gravity or other forces. You can then
/// add a number of force vectors together to get a final force to be applied to a character.

/// and height. This means that the rectangle always has edges that follow the sides of
/// the Window or Bitmap (so they are aligned with the x and y axes). The rectangle's
/// position is its top left corner - it then extends to the right and down from
